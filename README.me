# 🚀 Mercury Fleet API

API developed for fleet management, using a scalable and modern architecture based on Node.js.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

This project uses a robust stack focused on performance, type safety, and ease of development:

- **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/):** Main framework for building the API (modular architecture and dependency injection).
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** JavaScript superset that adds static typing.
- **[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/):** Modern ORM for database manipulation and migrations.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose:** Containerization of the application and auxiliary services (Database, etc.).
- **[SWC](https://swc.rs/):** Compiler written in Rust, making builds and tests up to 20x faster than the standard compiler.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Tools to ensure code quality and standardization.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows an organized structure where infrastructure configuration is at the root and application code is in a subfolder:
